## Expo Go Setup Documentation

### Objective

Mobile development with React Native requires device testing, which traditionally involves emulators that demand significant hardware resources. To streamline the development process and avoid these hardware constraints, we’re using the Expo Framework. It allows direct app testing on physical devices using the Expo Go app, making development faster, smoother, and more accessible.

### Prerequisites

Before starting this task, the following tools were already installed:

- Node.js LTS – for JavaScript runtime and project setup  
- Visual Studio Code – recommended IDE for editing and managing the codebase  
- Compatible OS – using macOS / Linux / Windows (user-specific)  
- Physical iOS device – for testing the mobile application  

### Expo Go Installation Process (iOS)

1. Visited the [official Expo Go homepage](https://expo.dev/go).
2. Selected the latest SDK version (done automatically based on the Expo Go version).
3. Installed the Expo Go app via the Apple App Store.
4. Opened the app on my iPhone.
5. Created an Expo account and successfully logged in.

### Purpose of Using Expo Go

- Eliminates the need for heavy Android or iOS emulators.
- Allows real-time preview and testing of React Native apps on a real device.
- Supports QR code scanning for instant app deployment during development.
- Cross-platform: works equally well for Android and iOS devices.

### Challenges Faced

No issues encountered during installation and setup.  
The process was smooth and the app was ready for use immediately after login.
